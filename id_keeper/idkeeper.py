# The task is simple, print the password and username for the input key word.
# First step run as:
#   #python idkeeper.py gmail
#   #wang@gmail.com:123456
#
# Then next step may provide interactive mode:
#   #python idkeeper.py
#   #Input the web name:
#    > gmail
#   #Your account for gmail is:
#   #wang@gmail.com:123456
#
# Then next step may provide fuzzy matching in case you can't remember the full/correct name of the web:
#   #python idkeeper.py
#   #Input the web name:
#     > mail
#   #Do you mean:
#    gmail
#    amail
#    bmail
#   Select the correct name and input again:
#    >gmail
#   #Your account for gmail is:
#   #wang@gmail.com:123456
#
# Then next step may provide binary file to run directly, for both linux and windows.
